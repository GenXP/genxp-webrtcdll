 A fully functional WebRTC Runtime Wrapper with a C/C++ provided WebRTCAPI.h header.
 
 ## What is it?
 This is a fully functional WebRTC C/C++ wrapper. First of all. We aren't the only wrapper out there. Other wrapper examples include:
 - [Microsoft's WinRTC WebRTC Wrapper](https://github.com/microsoft/winrtc/tree/master/WebRtcWrapper)
 - [Unity3D's WebRTC Plugin](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.webrtc)
 - NodeJS WebRTC Wrapper
 - [Wk Webview WebRTC Shim](https://github.com/common-tater/wkwebview-webrtc-shim)

However, to our knowledge we are the **only** C compatible runtime wrapper. We've negotiated the complexity of WebRTC to an easy to use Wrapper.

## Runtime & Callbacks

## Examples

## Header
Our API is contained to one simple API header ```WebRTCAPI.h``` which provides runtime support to the WebRTC library.
